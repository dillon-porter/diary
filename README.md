# diary
A scrimba project

A personal Diary Application - Built from mostly JavaScript by manipulating the DOM. We used a bit of HTML and CSS for styling.

Description: 
You enter some text and click the submit button to display the entry created in the below text field.
You click on the entry buttons to display what you typed. Each time you click the entry button a new entry appears so they don't all display at once.
